title: PHP MySQL Abstraction
tags: php, code, web

In a handful of hours, and under 150 lines of code, I wrote an abstraction layer on top of MySQL in PHP. It provides a query method that allows the "question mark syntax" in SQL statements and returns the resulting database rows as objects. Rather than explaining, it's probably better if I just give you an example:

    class UsersModel
    {
        function print_name()
        {
            echo $this->first_name . ' ' . $this->last_name;
        }
    }
    
    $users = $db->query('SELECT  FROM `users`');
    $users[0]->print_name();

Check out the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/cloakedcode/php-mysql) or read the one [page of documentation](https://github.com/cloakedcode/php-mysql/wiki). I encourage you to use this code as if it were your own, I've relinquished all rights to the code (see the UNLICENSE file).
