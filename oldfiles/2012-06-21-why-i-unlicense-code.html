title: Why I Unlicense Code
tags: code, development, programming

For a long time I wanted my name on everything I did, that is, every piece of code I wrote. I wanted my name to be displayed prominently, proudly, at the top of every file so everyone could see what I'd done. Now I don't care.

I don't care if you know that I wrote the code. I don't care if my name is in every file. All I care about is that you use the code if you find it useful and that if nothing else, you have the opportunity to learn something from the way it was written. Isn't that one of the joys of open source?

That's why I've chosen to [unlicense](http://unlicense.org) any source code I release from here on out. I'd rather someone use my code, even if that means claiming it as their own, than throw together some trashy, hacked up excuse for source code. And if someone stumbles across code I've written and it teaches them something new, even better.

For now what I write is much cleaner and more maintainable than a lot of code I've seen. However, let me humbly admit, my code is probably not great. I've often returned to code a month or two later and been dismayed at what I'd done. I'm constantly improving, but, for example, the PHP MySQL layer I [wrote about yesterday](/2012/06/20/php-mysql-abstraction.php) is a lot nicer to work with than the low-level mysql_query, etc. calls.
