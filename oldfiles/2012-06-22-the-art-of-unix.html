title: The Art of Unix
tags: development, programming

Today I got the opportunity to read the first two chapters of [The Art of Unix Programming](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/) and found the details of the Unix philosophy very enlightening. It resonated deeply with me because from a very early point in learning programming I had the [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle drilled into me. I am ever so thankful that it was and am delighted to know it has been a long tradition in the Unix culture. I love Unix even a little bit more now.

If you don't have time to read the whole book but have been told on more than one occasion to read this book, as I have, I *highly* recommend the first chapter on philosophy. It covers some great ideas that are very worth your time and will have a lasting impact on how you program. More specifically, it will make programming fun and I found it inspiring me to rewrite [pier](https://github.com/cloakedcode/pier) with the intent of making it adhere to the Unix philosophy.

What are you waiting for? Go [read that chapter](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/philosophychapter.html), it'll change your life.
