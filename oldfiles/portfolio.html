# People I've worked with

Here are a couple people, like yourself, that I helped.

## Lisa and Google Analytics
[Lisa Bertuzzi](http://lisabertuzzi.com) wanted Google Analytics installed on her website so she could see who visited her site. With a couple hours of work, it was installed and the next day she was tracking her visitors.

Here's what she said:

> [...] I asked Alan to set up google analytics. He made it so easy, and explained everything about it. Whenever I contact him for questions, he always has the answer. Plus, he's very friendly. What a valuable combo!

## Lynn and a virus
[Lynn Elliot](http://media-demo.com) had a virus infect one of her websites and needed it removed. The website was kept intact and the virus was removed. To make sure other hackers couldn't get in the way the first one had, the security hole was patched.
