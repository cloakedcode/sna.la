title: The #1 Secret to Security
tags: security, programming, development

As I was designing the payment system for a new [bitcoin project](http://bitcoinstarter.com), I realized a secret/principle of security that is not mentioned as often as it should be:

  Security is about limiting everything to the point of functioning and no more.

That is to say, if a system accepts invalid input, or allows a function to be executed that shouldn't, it's insecure. When a system is limited to exact specifications, it can be viewed as secure. Perhaps not impenetrable, theoretically nothing is, but it will be secure. The easiest point of exploitation is user input, and this is where the above mentioned principle comes into play. All input, *all* input, should be validated/filtered down to only what is allowed, nothing more.
