title: MacBook Pro not booting beyond white screen
tags: macbook, repair

Someone brought a 2009 MacBook Pro into work to have it looked at because it wasn't booting beyond the white startup screen. The computer would turn on but the grey Apple logo never appeared. Additionally, it wasn't possible to display the [boot menu](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310) by holding Option while it started up.

The [common fix](https://www.google.com/search?q=macbook+pro+white+screen+of+death) for this issue is to replace the motherboard. At least, that's what Apple did for a lot of people who reported this problem on forums. But that's very expensive.

This was mystifying so we concluded that the hard drive had died, because the folder icon with a flashing question mark appeared on screen after a few minutes (shown when there is no bootable disk found). However, after plugging in another, working, hard drive, it still did not recognize the disk.

On a hunch I grabbed the hard drive cable from another MacBook Pro and plugged it in. Success! The hard drive was not the damaged component, but the cable. After a $15 [purchase on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=macbook+pro+2009+hard+drive+cable&_sacat=0&_odkw=macbook+pro+2009+hard+drive+cable&_osacat=0&_trksid=p3286.c0.m270.l1313), and a little wait for the package to arrive from Hong Kong, I plopped a new cable into the laptop. It was back to functioning, and needless to say, the owner was very happy to have it back and not have to pay ~$750 to have Apple replace the motherboard (~$300 on ebay) or ~$150 for a new hard drive.
