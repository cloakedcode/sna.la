title: Installing a Printer on Backtrack
tags: linux, backtrack, howto

I am lucky enough to work for IT on my college's campus. They gave me the task of cleaning out a back closet, full of old, unneeded, stuff. One of the items was a Samsung laser printer (built-in duplexer!). I snagged that, what I didn't want was to be recycled, and installed it in my room. Having not installed a printer from scratch before I had some learning to do. It's really easy on linux (in my case Backtrack 5).

## Installation Steps on Linux
 1. Install CUPS: `sudo apt-get install lsb`
 2. Add your user to the `sys` group: `sudo usermod -aG sys root`
 3. [Download the driver](http://www.openprinting.org/drivers) for your printer series.
 4. Install the driver: `sudo dpkg --install driver.deb`
 5. Open the [CUPS web interface](http://localhost:631).
 6. Click `Add Printer` and enter your username and password (e.g. root/password).
 7. Complete the wizard.
 8. Done! Print your file through Firefox or other program.

If you get caught up at any point along the way, the [CUPS manual](http://www.cups.org/doc-1.1/sam.html) may be of use. (Printers can be [managed from the command line](http://www.cups.org/doc-1.1/sam.html#4_3) if you want to do it that way.)

It was very satisfying to see a print come out of a salvaged printer. Beautiful!
