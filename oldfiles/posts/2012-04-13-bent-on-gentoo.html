title: Bent on Gentoo
tags: linux, college

Several of the guys in the IT department here are huge fans of [Gentoo](http://gentoo.org) and won't use anything else for the servers or their office/personal computers. That has always intrigued me, that they're so passionate about it when it always sounded like a huge pain to have to compile the entire OS.

A couple days ago at work one of the guys was telling me how he was trying to get linux on an old PowerBook G4 and had installed Gentoo. I had been afraid of Gentoo, it's intimidating to have to do everything to get the system up, right down to configuring the kernel; but if he could do it, so could I. So today I decided to give it a shot and install it on one of the recycled computers I've got lying around. I'm only as far as [configuring the kernel](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=7) but it's a great experience and I'm learning a lot even though I'm not even close to done.

If you want to really understand linux, and a [minimal distro](http://archlinux.org) is not teaching you anything, I highly recommend installing Gentoo. It's really not as bad as it might seem.
