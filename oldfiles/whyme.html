title: Why Me?

# Why should you hire me?

I have over 8 years of experience with computers and programming; the past 2 years I've worked professionally as a computer technician and programmer. I am also very good at listening, enjoy problem solving, and learn new things quickly.

### Where you come in
* Your frustrations and annoyances will be heard.
* You get someone who knows what they're doing and can answer your questions.
* I can make your life easier in the future when you make changes to your website.

### You get these hands
I am only one person but that means you're talking directly to the person doing the work. I'm not a contractor or a big business, I'm one guy.

### I love people
I will love listening to your problems and figuring out ways to make your life less stressful.

### Want to know more?
You should contact me and we'll chat. Ask any questions you like ("Do you think the moon is made of cheese?") or tell me about your problems. I won't charge you for the emails; [I'm here to listen](/contact.html).
