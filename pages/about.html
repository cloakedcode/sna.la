# About Me #

I learned computer programming at a young age and have been coding ever since. For the longest time it was purely a hobby. Then I did volunteer work for a [couple](http://rqs.ca) [people](http://alloutsoftware.com), and they paid me out of the goodness of their hearts. It remained a hobby for a couple more years and then I got hired doing PHP programming for a [web design shop](http://awpny.com). The people were great and I got to maintain their [in-house CMS](http://awpny.com/content/view/webtree.html). I have since left that job and do computer work for two non-profits that serve homeless [families](http://ihn-cos.org) and [individuals](http://www.westsidecares.org).

I've done everything from creating Mac desktop [applications](http://rqs.ca/RollingCredits), to developing iPhone apps, to creating [web apps](http://ambitiouslemon.com/member/login/). I've learned lots of programming languages; suffice it to say, unless it's an obscure language, I've probably used it.
