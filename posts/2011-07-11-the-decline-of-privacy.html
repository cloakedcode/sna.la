title: The Decline of Privacy
tags: privacy, plug_computer, facebook, google

Personal privacy is disappearing at an alarming rate, on the internet. There are a couple things that have encouraged me to invest more in my own privacy.

1. Identity theft is *huge*. Close family members have had their credit card info stolen multiple times in the past few months.
2. Degrading privacy on Facebook and [Dropbox](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/07/03/imDeletingMyDropboxAccount.html).
3. Google [tracking](http://donttrack.us/) and putting [me in a bubble](http://dontbubble.us/).

## What I'm doing about it

These are not happenings that we are helpless to remedy.

1. I have switched to a [better search engine](http://duckduckgo.com).
2. Deactivated my Facebook account long ago, and now will be deleting my Dropbox account. (I have no desire to share information with people I cannot meet in person or send an email to.)
3. I will be switching my email to a [secure provider](http://neomailbox.com/services/secure-email).
4. My files will be placed on a [plug](http://plugcomputer.org/), and accessible anywhere, but only to me.

Watch your back online, put up as little sensitive information as possible (i.e. none), and stay away from open wireless hotspots (it's easy for someone to steal information). Of course, there are other steps you should take, but they are all common sense, like these.
