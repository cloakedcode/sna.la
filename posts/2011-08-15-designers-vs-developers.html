title: Designers vs. Developers
tags: web, design, development, programming, ui, dribbble, github

With a cat on my lap, and the rain pattering on the roof, I took a stroll over to a [blog I'd been meaning to visit](http://maxvoltar.com). Not far from the top I came across [a post](http://maxvoltar.com/archive/we-re-all-mathematicians) relating interface designers to mathematicians. Because I have a love for UI design, and my mouth goes dry whenever I think about math, I was curious to see what Max was saying. He challenges the reader to not pull inspiration from designs, and instead decipher the *why* of designs. This makes a lot of sense, and will help a lot in my conquest to master design as a programmer.

## Designers like to look
But it got me thinking about the differences between designers and developers/programmers. I visited a [few](http://owltastic.com/) [more](http://morganallanknutson.com/) designers' sites, and realized what disappointed me about them: there wasn't a "Projects" section on any of them. As a developer I've become accustom to visiting sites and exploring the projects the other person, usually a fellow programmer, is working on. This provides me with a lot of information about the person, everything from what platforms they prefer to the types of problems they enjoy solving. However, the best part about these projects, is playing with them. Downloading them, messing around, trying to break them, you know, the usual.
Sadly, this fun cannot be had on the sites of designers. And this defines the difference between designers and developers. Designers create things to look at, while developers create things to make something happen. Let me be clear, when I say *designer*, I am talking about graphic and web design (the presentation of information), not UI design (making interfaces usable). UI design falls between making something to look at and something happen. As a developer myself, I prefer to make things happen rather than look at, and quickly become bored by the "Works" sections of designers because the works presented are not interactive, they're designs.

The designs of designers are what define them, just as the projects of developers define them.
