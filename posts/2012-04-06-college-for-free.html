title: College for Free
tags: learning, college

In a desparate hunt to master human anatomy and physiology, and learn new things for fun, I discovered [MIT's OpenCourseWare](ocw.mit.edu) project. It's a fantastic pool of courses, complete with course syllabus, assignments, exams, and often a variety of other resources, including video lectures and class notes. Once I ran across that I searched for other similar sites and found [a list of 8 of them](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/8-awesome-websites-free-college-courses-online/). I'm thinking maybe I'll learn Linear Algebra, just for fun.
