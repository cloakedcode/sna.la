title: Take a Look, it's in a Book
tags: books, ipad, college, ted

Here [at college](http://goshen.edu) a [new iPad program](http://goshen.edu/icore) was developed for the 2012-2013 Freshman. As a lover of technology, you'd expect me to be all for it, but as a lover of people, I'm not. [iPads are manufactured inhumanely](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/ieconomy-apples-ipad-and-the-human-costs-for-workers-in-china.html).

That's one reason I'm against our school buying ~200 of them. Another reason is I'm a huge fan of books (and paper). I love touching books. I love opening a new book and smelling that delightful aroma of freshly printed ink. I love turning pages and the anticipation of not knowing what I'll find when I turn the next one. I love putting books on a shelf and seeing all that insight, fantasy, and wisdom neatly lined up.

You can imagine my delight when I came across a [TED](http://ted.com) talk by a book cover designer who shared my sentiments. Have a listen, and look (it's quite funny, but not in a book):
