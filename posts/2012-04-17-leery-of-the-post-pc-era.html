title: Leary of the Post-PC Era
tags: ipad, technology, postpc

In modern terms I guess I'm a luddite as I don't have a cell phone. I'm not afraid of them, I just don't want to expose myself to the [radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health) or be part of the [always connected](http://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together.html) world.

So when I came across [a post](http://dcurt.is/post-post-pc-world) about Google's "[Project Glass](http://g.co/projectglass)" I was a little concerned.

Here at college, Apple products are becoming more and more a part of the campus, as if they're essential to facilitating our learning. I previously wrote about the new iPad program here at college which I don't think is necessary to our advancement as a college. Our IT Director is a huge proponent of Apple products and the post-pc era. But I don't think jumping in headlong is a good idea.

Technology separates humanity by putting us in front of a screen rather than interacting on a personal level with other people. And tearing down the barrier, making the screen smaller, literally, might make it easier to break away from it. But that also makes it more readily available. If cell phones are detracting from our relationships, imagine what computerized glasses or contact lenses could do.

As awesome as Google's glasses sound -- they do, I'd love a pair -- I'm a little leery. Computers, game consoles, and cell phones have both made our lives better while hurting them. So I'm going to [stick with books](/2012/04/07/take-a-look-its-in-a-book.html), pen and paper, and [old things](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/). I have a great love for the past, in particular the 60's, though you won't find me walking around in a suit.

Technology is great when we can *integrate* it into our lives, rather than allowing it to *become* our lives. We must be aware of how we use technology, be intentional about it, not allow it to control how we live and interact with each other.
