title: My Feet are Complaining
tags: health, movement

I have become increasingly intrigued by the barefoot movement. That is, the people who swear by going barefoot or at least wearing Vibram Five Finger shoes. My shoes are wearing out, and stink, and being on my feet most of the day causes shin splints, very uncomfortable. I know a handful of people who go barefoot nearly all the time and I'd heard it's better for your feet, even when running on hard surfaces. So I thought I'd look into it.

To my happy surprise the evidence is strong for the benefits of going barefoot. My shin splits should go away if I stop wearing shoes and learn to step differently. I won't have to worry about stinky feet and the skin between my toes won't peel from being pushed together. And it's legal to [enter establishments in the U.S. barefoot](http://www.barefooters.org/health-dept/) as well as [drive barefoot](http://www.barefooters.org/driving/).

For more info about going barefoot, check out the [Society for Barefoot Living](http://www.barefooters.org). If you're not convinced it's healthy, or think I'm a fool, check out this video by a Harvard professor who researched the subject:
