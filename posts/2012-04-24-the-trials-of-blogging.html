title: The Trials of Blogging
tags: blogging

It has been days since I've written anything here, for one reason: I'm not sure I want to continue to write. What's the point?

The point would be clear if I was trying to make money. I'd develop a "target audience", find a "niche market", write highly specialized/specific content, and attract a following by being active in those communities (e.g. forums, mailing lists, Facebook groups, etc.). Finding your target audience is one of the top tips for a successful blog, according to sites like [ProBlogger](http://problogger.net) and any others you'll find with a quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+write+a+successful+blog) how to write a blog.

However, I'm not doing it for money. I don't want a target audience as that would restrict what I could write about. I don't devote my daily life to one field so I can't write on one subject every day. I want a place where I can share anything, whatever comes to mind. Kind of like writing a letter to a close friend, but the whole world can see it.

So I've decided to label this as a "personal blog". It doesn't have a specific goal, or target audience, or even a purpose. It's a place for me to share my thoughts and opinions on anything and everything.
