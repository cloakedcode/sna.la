Hello world!

I used to have a blog here with a number of posts. However, they were disorganized and I had spit them out without any real plan or goal for this blog. So I'm starting over with a clear plan and publishing schedule. I will publish new content on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Many times I've attempted to start a blog about programming but never succeeded. I'd give up too easily. I'm starting again with new found determination.

I am doing this for a handful of reasons:

1. To establish credibility as a programmer.
2. To give back to the programming community.
3. To provide new programmers with resources to begin their journey.

I will do this by writing about web development and how to teach yourself programming, and releasing code (snippets) for you to use and maybe learn from.

This should be a journey in and of itself. I'm excited!
