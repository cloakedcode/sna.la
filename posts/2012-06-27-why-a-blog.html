title: Why a Blog?
tags: blogging, programming

I wanted to learn programming when I was 11 or 12. (I like to think that's young but there are people who've learned at age 9.) Both of my parents learned to program in college on punch card computers and so were familiar with programming from its infancy. Don't worry, they didn't teach me with punch cards, they'd done programming later, when there were programming languages.

They taught me [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and I learned to do some simple [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29) drawing. My motivation for wanting to learn was to write an OS X desktop app. I wanted an app that could set the desktop background picture and make the window become transparent so I could see the whole background and decide if that was the picture I was going to stick with. But BASIC was a long way from desktop apps. So I grabbed the most [basic C book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672305100/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=als038-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0672305100) I could find (see what I did there?). It turns out that was one of the best intro programming books I've ever seen.

A year or two later I was able to program using the Cocoa framework and wrote the app I had envisioned. [It's actually still online!](http://youtellme.meadowsweetfarm.com/software/backFlap.htm) I helped people on the cocoa-dev mailing list and volunteered to do work for a couple of the developers there. I [rewrote one app](http://rqs.ca/RollingCredits/index.php) and [added to another](http://web.archive.org/web/20090220135927/http://alloutsoftware.com/) and worked on a lot of my own projects in between.

I eventually got bored with OS X desktop programming and turned to web development. I picked up [PHP](http://php.net) quickly and then [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) came along. It looked exciting and I was impressed that a blog could be developed in 20 minutes. But then I did some reading. Hosting was expensive (it's not anymore) the language was confusing (I hadn't learned many languages at this point) and the framework was bloated and constricting. I decided to stick with PHP and write my own framework; there were existing frameworks but they did a poor job of cloning RoR. I wrote my own and when I volunteered to help rewrite the backend of a [non-profit web host](http://ambitiouslemon.com) convinced them to allow me to use it for that project. A few years later I got hired as the programmer for a [web shop](http://awpny.com) based on my work with that framework. The rest is history.


Over the years I've tried to blog and think it's now finally the next step in my development as a programmer. I've learned a lot since I began programming 10 years ago and want to share all of that knowledge with people who wish to start programming. There's so much to learn it can be overwhelming to dive into. But I'm blogging to prove to (potential) clients that I've been at this for a while and know what I'm doing.

Hopefully you will learn a thing or two about programming from my writings. I'd like to say I'll inspire you to program but I doubt I have such fantastic powers of persuasion.
