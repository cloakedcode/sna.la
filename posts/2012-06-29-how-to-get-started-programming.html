title: How to Get Started Programming
tags: programming

You might be confused and overwhelmed about getting started with programming. Don't worry, it's really easy.

You really don't need anything except a good book and a computer. You certainly don't need to buy software -- you'll discover that in the programming world a lot of the best things are free.

The place to start is with this book: [The Absolute Beginner's Guide to C](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672305100/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=als038-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0672305100). It is the best introduction to computer programming I've come across, and it's the book I used to teach myself 10 years ago. The book is carefully laid out and very easy to read. I was 11 or 12 when I read it and had no trouble understanding it; you'll do fine.

Once you've read through that book, and written some of your own fun programs, [learn Python](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/). It'll teach you about objects and classes, garbage collectors, interpreted languages, and a bunch of other neat things. But that's still a ways in the future, you don't need to worry about that yet.

Go grab a copy of that book, some coffee, and a pencil to write in the margins. Curl up with the book and have fun! Programming is fun, that's why you're learning it, right?
