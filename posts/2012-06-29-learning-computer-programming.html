title: Learning Computer Programming
tags: programming

There is a lot to learn about computers and programming them. When you realize that it can be intimidating and overwhelming and might stop you from getting started. But don't be scared, once you learn to program everything gets considerably less frightening.

You might be stuck trying to figure out where to start. What language should you learn first? Can you use your computer? Do you need to buy software?

You really don't need anything except a good book and a computer. If you've got a computer, that's great, use it, it'll do fine. You certainly don't need to buy software -- you'll discover that in the programming world a lot of the best things are free.

The place to start is with this book: [The Absolute Beginner's Guide to C](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672305100/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=als038-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0672305100). It is the best introduction to computer programming I've come across, and it's the book I used to teach myself 10 years ago.

Once you've read through that book and understood it, and played with writing your own programs, [learn Python](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/). But that's still a ways in the future, you don't need to worry about that yet.
