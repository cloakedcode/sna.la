title: 5 Reasons to Develop in Linux
tags: linux, programming

For someone starting to learn the ropes of programming there are three operating systems to choose from: Windows, OS X, and Linux. Don't even think about using Windows. Yes, you can learn to code on a Windows box except it's anything but convenient and straightforward. OS X is much better for development than Windows but Linux is even better.

There are a number of reasons why you should choose Linux over the others:

## 1. Easy to setup a development environment
Once you've got Linux installed, whether it be in a virtual machine or directly to your hard drive, getting the tools to start programming (e.g. a compiler) is usually only one package/command away. For example, on a Debian-based distro you can enter this into the terminal and it will install the necessary files/programs:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

## 2. Loaded with libraries
Most Linux distros come with thousands of packages. Think of a package as an installer, it's a special file that specifies which files to install and where to place them. The power of having packages does not come from packages themselves but the sheer number. Virtually any program or library you want is at your fingertips.

This makes programming much, much easier on Linux than other operating systems. When you start to develop programs that require third-party libraries, no need to download them, compile, and install because that's probably already been done and bundled in a package.

## 3. It's Open Source
You'll be supporting other programmers who volunteer to put in countless hours of hard work into Linux.

And if you ever feel so inclined you can read the source code for everything on your system.

## 4. The command line is right there
OS X is the only rival of Linux on this front. As you get better you'll appreciate the command line more and more. With a string of words you can accomplish anything you would do with a graphical interface and so much more. You won't know what you're missing until you [give it a try](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php).

## 5. Community support from other programmers
There are huge communities of people who can help you diagnose problems and teach you along the way. The people are friendly, helpful, and encouraging. One of the biggest for general Linux support is the [Ubuntu Forums](http://ubuntuforums.org/). As a programmer, however, you'll find [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) invaluable.

Now, go install Linux. Grab [a copy of Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and install it. In a later post I'll discuss the 4 ways you can install it, and which one I recommend for beginners.
