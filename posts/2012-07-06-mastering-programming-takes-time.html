title: Mastering Programming Takes Time
tags: learning, programming

It seems everyone is trying to learn programming quickly. They want to learn how to code, get it out of the way, and go straight to writing that app or website they've thought up. Beginners dive [straight into Ruby](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/10/dev-boot-camp-is-a-ruby-success/)! But learning the proper way will [take time](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html).

Taking the fast route is going to make you a terrible programmer. Let's say you've earned your badges from [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) and are ready to code up a website. You'll find you can't do much in the real world with your new "coding skillz". You didn't take the time to learn the basics of programming -- no, string manipulation is not the basics.

Memorizing function names, how to get a string length, what an if/else statement looks like, etc. is not going to make you a programmer. Programming is much more than all of that: it's problem solving; program design; reading other peoples' code; and writing beautiful, simple code. Think of programming like writing poetry, except in a foreign language with a foreign culture.

Like learning a foreign language you cannot simply begin to memorize phrases. You might be able to ask where the bathroom is, or how to get to the bank, but you won't be able to say anything else, certainly not write poetry. To write poetry in a foreign language you've got to start slow, learn the grammar, and then read already written poetry.

To achieve this in programming you must start with a low-level language like C, [a good book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672305100/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=als038-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0672305100), and work your way towards making that website or writing that app. I didn't create my first Mac app overnight, [it took me a year or two](/2012/06/27/my-story.html).
