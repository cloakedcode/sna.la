title: Programmer's Skill: Patience
tags: programming, skill

I just read an interesting [article on frustration](http://benaugarten.com/learning/2012/07/08/learn-to-love-frustration/) as being an essential part of programming. That's only one side of the frustration coin. The other side is patience.

As a programmer you need a lot of patience, seemingly infinite. There are so many opportunities for something to go wrong: a bug pops up, a user breaks something, the user doesn't understand how to use the program, the code you just fixed broke something else, you've been working on the same problem for 5 hours straight and are completely stuck, etc.

In order to confront these problems without getting distraught or anxious you'll need patience, lots of it. You need to be able to keep a level head, take a step back, analyze the situation, decide how you're going to proceed, and possibly take a break and go for a walk. (Breaks, walks especially, have an almost mystical power to reveal the solution to a problem.)

As you gain experience programming you'll develop patience as a skill. You'll learn how to evaluate problems, take another look at a bug, re-explain something to a user who just doesn't get it, and know when to quit and come back to it later. (That last one in particular is a mark of a good programmer.) You'll be able to do all of those things without losing your cool.

Computers don't react to your frustration and impatience with sympathy or understanding so you'll be best suited to let go of your emotions and practice patience. If you want to get a jump start as a programmer, start developing patience throughout your life.
