title: 4 Ways to Install Linux
tags: linux, ubuntu

There are four ways you should consider running linux.

## 1. In VirtualBox (recommended for beginners)

[VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) is a program that allows you to run other OS's, without replacing your current OS. In other words, you can keep Windows or OS X installed while you run Linux on top of that.

This has some huge advantages, like not needing to mess with your hard drive partitioning or installing a bootloader, and is very easy to setup. If you ever want to remove the Linux machine you simply delete the files.

I recommend this for beginners as it allows you to get Linux up and running with very little effort or expertise.

## 2. Dual boot with your current OS

You can have Linux installed with your current OS. This allows you to choose between them every time you start your computer. However, as I mentioned above you're going to have to partition your hard disk and install a bootloader. Those are potentially difficult tasks if you've never done them before.

*(Ubuntu can do all this automatically, without special knowledge on your part.)*

## 3. Replace your current OS

Accomplishing this is pretty straightforward and easy. But your old OS will be lost forever and you may not be ready to dive headfirst into Linux. If you are ready, do so, by all means!

## 4. From a USB stick

If your computer can boot from a USB stick you can put Linux on it. Instructions for this are obviously far beyond the scope of this post, but it's not difficult. However, I don't recommend it for beginners as it might be more trouble than it's worth at this point.

I strongly encourage you to grab a copy of [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) and put it in VirtualBox. Try a tutorial on [installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox](http://navet.ics.hawaii.edu/~casanova/VirtualBoxUbuntuHowTo.html).
