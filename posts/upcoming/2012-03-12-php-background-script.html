title: PHP background script
tags: php, code, script

For this blog I needed to run a script in the background, so as not to block the users loading of the page. I knew this was possible because I'd seen it done (I think I first saw it in Drupal's cron script). A quick search with Google and I found what I was after:

    ignore_user_abort(true);
    set_time_limit(0);
